Understanding risks in economic and financial systems is crucial for both policymakers and businesses. Events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian-Ukrainian war, and natural business cycle fluctuations significantly impact economies. Traditional low-frequency data and average-focused models provide limited insights. This study employs a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive (BVAR) model within a Bayesian framework to offer a more detailed risk analysis. In this approach we use a real-time data set, to generate and evaluate forecasts from the mixed-frequency VAR and compare them to forecasts from a VAR that is estimated based on data time-aggregated to quarterly frequency. We document how information that becomes available within the quarter improves the forecasts in real time.
